# Blind SSRF
Blind SSRF vulnerabilities arise when an application can be induced to issue a back-end HTTP request to a supplied URL, but the response from the back-end request is not returned in the application's front-end response

## Different Methods:

### Methodology #1:
**Header** **Injection**:

One way of finding them is by inserting your burp collaborator domain into the referrer header also known as host header injection.

Snippet:
```
    GET /HTTP 1.1
    Host: site.tld
    User Agent: Firefox
    Referrer: https://your_collaborator_instance.com

```
