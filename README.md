# Web-Pentesting-Checklist
Web application penetration testing is a process of identifying and assessing any vulnerabilities and security weaknesses in a web application. A penetration test is designed to simulate an attack on the web application to identify any weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers.

A penetration testing checklist is used as a guide to ensure that all aspects of the web application are tested thoroughly. This checklist typically includes various categories, such as authentication, authorization, input validation, error handling, and session management, among others.

Some of the key areas that are typically included in a web application penetration testing checklist are:

- Authentication and Authorization: Testing the authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users have access to the application and its features.
- Input Validation: Testing the input validation mechanisms to ensure that user input is checked for validity and does not contain any malicious code or scripts.
- Error Handling: Testing the error handling mechanisms to ensure that the application handles errors gracefully and does not provide any sensitive information to attackers.
- Session Management: Testing the session management mechanisms to ensure that sessions are properly managed and cannot be hijacked by attackers.
- Database Security: Testing the database security to ensure that sensitive information is properly stored and access to the database is restricted.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Testing for XSS vulnerabilities to ensure that the application is not vulnerable to XSS attacks.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Testing for CSRF vulnerabilities to ensure that the application is not vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
- Injection Attacks: Testing for injection attacks, such as SQL injection, to ensure that the application is not vulnerable to these types of attacks.
- Configuration Management: Testing the configuration management to ensure that the application is properly configured and that there are no unnecessary services or ports open.

By using a web application penetration testing checklist, testers can ensure that all areas of the web application are tested thoroughly, and any vulnerabilities are identified and addressed before they can be exploited by attackers.
